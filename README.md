Zend Server Web Api Client
==========

The plugin is targeted mainly to make it easier to check and execute web APIs (web services) that Zend Server provides. 
Once installed, a new page will be added under "Administration" section in the main menu on the left (After a refresh of the UI in the browser).

This plugin scans the entire code of Zend Server and tries to identify all the available web services. 

Yet not all of the possible web APIs appear in the plugin and you might find some services missing - In this case, you may write the web service name directly into the action field

The page was created by Gregory Chris (gregory.chris@roguewave.com) 2016. Enjoy, and visit zend.com to check other products and services.
